## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on transforming raw retail sales data into **actionable business insights** through **data storytelling** and **visual analytics**. Using a cleaned version of Walmart's sales dataset, I created a comprehensive Power BI report to help stakeholders answer critical questions about sales, customers, profitability, and operations.

🎯 The goal was to **tell a story** with the data — not just show numbers.

- **Power BI** – for interactive visualizations and dashboard design
- **Python (Pandas)** – for data cleaning and preparation
- **Microsoft Excel** – to explore and structure the original dataset
- **DAX (Power BI)** – to build dynamic calculated fields and KPIs

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Summary

The raw dataset (from Superstore-style data) was cleaned in Python using Pandas:
- Removed missing & duplicate records
- Converted date fields and calculated delivery duration
- Standardized columns and filtered out anomalies (e.g., negative sales)
- Derived features like `Year`, `Month`, and `Delivery Days`

➡️ See `DataCleaningNotebook.ipynb` for full code walkthrough.
